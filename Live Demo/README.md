# Overview

In this project, I built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. I have used the 2013 Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset (https://datarepository.wolframcloud.com/resources/FER-2013). The dataset consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). I used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. Once the model has been trained, saved, and exported the CNN, I use the trained model to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data. The video input can be changed to take in webcam by uncommenting one line of code. Real time perfomance depends on the hardware specifications.

# Pipeline

1) Take the video stream and convert it to frames. Use Haar cascades to identify and draw bounding box around faces.

2) Pass the Region of Interest (Face patch) to the pretrained model. Use Forward feed to detect the expression.

3) Take the output of the model and add the label to the image and return the frame as a 'jpeg' file.

4) Use flask to publish the resulting frames onto the website. (HTML file has the template for video output) The output is deployed on 'http://localhost:5000/' web address.

# Command to run code
```
python main.py
```
# Certification 

Coursera certificate for the project: https://coursera.org/share/cb5b1cee88ad5ded6055c0f0c3adeaa4

# Known Issues/Bugs

The Haar Cascades are not the most robust way of identifying faces. Observed a few false face detections at times near a person's neck. A better approach would be to use DLib library for a faster and more accurate face detection. (http://dlib.net/) Would be working on Dlib library for future projects.

The data in the 'Disgust' class can be augmented to get a more generalized model.
